# libft

<br>**About The Project**

The first 42 project with basic C functions.

The project goal was to mimic the behaviour of basic standard C functions in order to create a libft.a library that can be used for further projects.

The bonus part is basically dedicated to the basic understanding of working with structures.

The project was graded with 125% and will be extended with additional functions as needed.



<br>**Usage**

To create libft.a without bonus part, run:

`make all 
`

To create libft.a with the bonus part, run:

`make bonus
`

<br>**IMPORTANT:**

The additional functions are stored under the folder 'additional_functions' 
and don't belong to the actual 42 project.
